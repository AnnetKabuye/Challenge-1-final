            <p>The Information System (IS) Department is one of the four academic departments at the School of Computing and Informatics Technology. 
                The department provides both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Some areas of the study and research in IS include:
                <ul><li>System Analysis and Design </li>
                <li>Data warehouses</li>
            <li>Databases</li>Health Informatics </li> <li>Management Information Systems</li><li>Decision Support Systems.</li></ul>
                These provide students with a thorough knowledge of the field thus providing an enduring foundation for future professional growth.  
                IS students learn to become problem solvers in organizations, institutions, the economy and society. </p> 
                <p>
                The department currently has two dynamic research groups namely: Simulation and Modeling Group and Visualization group. 
                The department has 15 full time academic staff and a diverse collection of part time faculty to support the teaching needs forâ€š
                the IS student community.  Administrative staff members supervised by the Head of Department ensure the smooth functioning of the

                    Information systems specialists focus on integrating information technology solutions and business processes to meet 
                    the information needs of businesses and other enterprises, enabling them to achieve their objectives in an effective, efficient way. 
                    This discipline perspective on information technology emphasizes information, and views technology as an instrument for generating, processing, 
                    and distributing information. </p>
            <p>Professionals in the discipline are primarily concerned with the information that computer systems can provide to aid an 
            enterprise in defining and achieving its goals, and the processes that an enterprise can implement or improve using information technology. 
            They must understand both technical and organizational factors, and they must be 
            able to help an organization determine how information and technology-enabled business processes can provide a competitive advantage.</p>
